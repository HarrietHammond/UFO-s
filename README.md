#### To provide an in-depth analysis of UFO sightings through the use of a filter for multiple criteria simultaneously. Filters for date, city, state, country and shape are included in this project. This will complement Dana's webpage and dynamic table.

## Summary

####  A drawback to this webpage is the inability to easily filter parameters due to the absence of a button for filtering. 

#### Two reccomendations for futher development should consider the addition of a reset botton and a filter button. These will make resetting to baseline and filtering of parameters easy and make the webpage user friendly.
